# Laravel Meta Fields

Laravel meta fields attempts to bring the powerful concept of the popular WordPress plugin advanced custom fields into Laravel for quick rich content and management form field creation. Meta field schemas are attached to models and provide rich content fields such as text, dropdown, wysiwyg which can be managed and searched. The idea is not to replace model properties but to extend models with customisable content focused meta values using a simplied meta table of key value pairs.
